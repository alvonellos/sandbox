  This repository is for, well, sandbox code. If it
doesn't deserve it's own repository, then I'm going
to put it here. 

  I create more code snippets than I do actual pro-
grams, and so the idea is that the sum of these
little chunks of code can maybe serve as a reference,
so long as they are well documented.
