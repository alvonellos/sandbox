  This is some SQLite code that creates a sqlite database and some triggers
that are used to calculate a factorial using pure SQL. 

Running:
	Precondition:
		SQLite3 must be installed in your path. 
		Python (If you want to use the run script)
	Postcondition:
		factorial.db is created an (optionally)
		populated with values
	Steps:
		1). In the shell, type "python run.py"
		2). If the python script doesn't work, type:
			a). "sqlite3 factorial.db < init.sql"
			b). "sqlite3 factorial.db < values.sql"
		3). Use sqlite3 to query the database, for example:
			a). "sqlite3 factorial.db"
			b). "select * from factorial"
	
Files:
	VERSION.txt:
		Contains the version information of the sqlite build
		I used to write this
	README:
		This file
	run.py:
		An (optional) python script given as a shortcut way to
		run the commands. 
	values.sql:
		Test data
	init.sql:
		Initialize the database to insert values in it. This file
		contains all the code used to write the recursive triggers
		and such.
	factorial.db:
		The result of running run.py on my computer. You can compare
		and contrast results if you'd like.
	factorial.bak:
		A backup database file. Same thing as above.
